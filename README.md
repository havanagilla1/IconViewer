<h2>Description</h2>
<p><b>IconViewer</b> is a free Windows Explorer extension that lets you easily view, copy, and save icons contained within programs and libraries. Open a file's Properties box, select the "Icons" tab, and view the icons contained in the file. </p>
<p><b>New:</b> IconViewer 3.02 is available for download, adding support for viewing Windows Vista icons when running on Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, and fixing a bug with IconViewer in the Add/Remove Programs list in Windows XP.</p>
<h2>What is IconViewer?</h2>
<p>IconViewer is a freeware product developed by Bot Productions. It is a utility that allows you to view the icons contained within files, such as executable files and dynamic link libraries (DLLs). </p>
<p>IconViewer is a shell extension, a plugin for Windows Explorer. When you open the Properties box for a file containing icons, an extra Icons tab will appear. Clicking on this tab brings up the IconViewer property page, and it lists the icons that the file contains. </p>
<p>Key IconViewer features include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>View icons contained in single or multiple files</li>
  <li>Copy device images to the clipboard</li>
  <li>Save icons and device images to a separate file</li>
  <li>Supports Windows XP 32-bit icons</li>
  <li>Supports Windows Vista PNG icons</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using IconViewer</h2>
<p>To use IconViewer, you must display the properties for a file or group of selected files. If you wish to view the icons in multiple files, first select the desired files. To open the properties, right click on the desired file (or one of the files, if viewing multiple files). Then, select the Properties item from the context menu. </p>

<p>If the file(s) contain icons, the Properties box will include the <b>Icons tab</b>, which contains the IconViewer window. The top portion of the IconViewer window contains a list of all the icons in the selected file(s). To view the device images for a specific icon, click the icon in the list. Then, the <b>Device images</b> list will list the various device images in the icon, allowing you to choose one to view. </p>

<p>Windows Vista introduces support for 256x256 PNG device images. These images are too large to fit in the preview area, so they are displayed in a flyout window: </p>

<p>IconViewer includes a detailed help file. To display help, click the <b>Help</b> button in the IconViewer window. </p>
<h2>Uninstallation</h2>
<p>To remove IconViewer, use the Control Panel's Add or Remove Programs feature. On Windows Vista, this feature is called "Uninstall a program." Be sure that no properties dialog boxes are open, or the IconViewer files may not be properly removed. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> On Windows NT, 2000, XP, and newer versions, uninstalling IconViewer requires administrator privileges. On Windows Vista, you will be prompted for administrative credentials. </p>
